# stan-skirmish-server
The sorta-backend for spotify-stan-skirmishes, maybe this should belong in the main project. I'm experimenting
with authentication via user login/redirecting, so that api calls can be made client-side.

I still have to link the front end with the back end, but I can reliably get access tokens.

You can find the main app [here](https://github.com/ninehusky/spotify-stan-skirmishes).

I'm gonna be tinkering around more with express, but hopefully I'll be able to link the backend with a front end soon.
